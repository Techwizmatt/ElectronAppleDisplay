# Apple Display

This is a minimal Electron application with a looping Gif pulled from Apple's Careers page.

## To Use

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Techwizmatt/ElectronAppleDisplay
# Go into the repository
cd ElectronAppleDisplay
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

The software was set up on a minimal version of Raspbian that lacked a desktop interface. I utilized x11 to configure the system to launch this Electron-based application directly, which was then displayed on a screen fitted into the cutout of a 2012 MacBook Pro lid.
